# CNN-Based-Heart-Sound-Analysis
We apply the A-Test to three variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), using raw heart sound signals as input. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework provides a fairer and more robust validation compared to repeated random sub-sampling and standard k-fold cross-validation.
